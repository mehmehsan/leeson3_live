                <p>We see really catastrophic impacts that are very distressing to us</p>

                <img src="climate.jpg" height="300" width="500">

                <p>Dangerously high temperatures put hundreds of thousands of people’s health and livelihoods at risk
                    every year, and a major new report shows how much the threat has already grown in a warming world.
                    Among other alarming statistics, heat-related deaths among older adults grew by nearly 54 percent
                    between 2000 and 2018, the report finds.</p>

                <p>
                    The sweeping health and climate change report was published today in the prominent medical journal
                    The Lancet. The report was produced by more than 100 experts from academia, the World Health
                    Organization, and other UN agencies. The report offers proof that climate change will not only
                    reshape life in the future, but it is actively endangering lives now. Health care providers already
                    see themselves treating a climate crisis.</p>

                <p>
                    Doctors held back tears during a briefing with reporters when asked to reflect on the results of the
                    report and how it connected to their experiences in emergency rooms as the COVID-19 pandemic spread
                    around the world. “It’s been a really, really hard year,” said Jeremy Hess, an emergency medicine
                    physician and co-author of the study, before taking a long pause to collect himself. “We see really
                    catastrophic impacts that are very distressing to us.” Heatwaves and other natural disasters were
                    particularly dangerous this year, as emergency responders and health care systems struggled to
                    handle the pandemic. Experts fear that climate-related disasters could similarly overwhelm hospitals
                    in the future.

                    “We really implore people to learn with us from our experience this year, and try and avoid the
                    worst,” Hess said. “We don’t want our health system to be overwhelmed by climate change impacts, and
                    we know what we need to do to stop this.”

                <p>
                    Rising temperatures have also triggered more wildfires, which poses another set of health threats.
                    Globally, the risk of people being exposed to a wildfire grew in a majority of the world’s countries
                    in recent years when compared to the period between 2001 and 2004. The US saw one of the biggest
                    increases in risk, with a 19 percent rise in daily exposures to wildfires. That means more people
                    are breathing in more soot and pollution from the blazes.</p>

                <p>

                    Fortunately, other studies have shown how taking ambitious action on climate change can save
                    thousands of lives. “We don’t want to have regret that we didn’t do everything we could in order to
                    prevent what we know is coming,” says Renee Salas, an emergency medicine doctor and lead author of a
                    policy brief accompanying today’s new report. “That’s why we’re pleading [with people] to listen to
                    the science. Let the science guide us, and prevent the most catastrophic outcomes that could lie
                    ahead if we don’t do something.”
